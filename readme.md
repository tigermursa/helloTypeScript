## Basic Types (Primitives and Reference)

1. Primitive Types:
   number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floats. 1 2 3 , 22.20
   string: Represents textual data. abc Abc
   boolean: Represents true or false values.

2. Array: A collection of values of the same type, like a list.

3. Tuple: An array with a fixed number of elements where each element can be of a different type.

4. Enum: A way to define a set of named constants, making it easier to manage a collection of related values.

5. Special Types:
   any: Can hold any type of value; disables type checking.
   unknown: Like any, but safer since type checking is required before use.
   void: Used when a function doesn't return a value.
   null: Represents the absence of a value.
   undefined: Indicates that a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
   never: Represents a type that never occurs (e.g., a function that never returns).

Tasks
Task 1: Basic Data Types and First Program
Objective: Write a TypeScript program that outputs a welcome message.

Instructions:

Create a TypeScript program.
Print the following message to the console:
Hello World, I will complete this course successfully and become a Next level Web Developer!

Task 2: Functions, Optional, and Literal Types
Objective: Create a function with parameters and an optional literal type.

Instructions:

Define a function that takes:
name (string)
age (number)
role (optional, with type 'admin' | 'user' | 'guest')
The function should log these values or perform a basic action.
Task 3: Object Types, Type Alias, & Literal Types
Objective: Define a structured Person object using Type Aliases.

Instructions:

Define a Person type alias with properties for Name, Address, Hair and Eye Color, Income and Expense, Hobbies, Family Members, Job, Skills, Marital Status, and Friends.
Task 4: Union and Intersection Types
Objective: Create union and intersection types using interfaces.

Instructions:

Define interfaces Book and Magazine.
Create:
A type that is a union of Book and Magazine.
A type that is an intersection of Book and Magazine.
Task 5: Function Type
Objective: Write a function that reverses a string.

Instructions:

Write a function reverseString that:
Takes a single string argument.
Returns the string in reverse order.
Example:
Input: "hello"
Output: "olleh"
Task 6: Spread and Rest Operators, Destructuring
Objective: Write a function that uses the rest operator for variable-length arguments.

Instructions:

Create a function that takes multiple numeric arguments (using the rest operator) and returns the sum of all arguments.
Task 7: Type Assertion and Narrowing
Objective: Write a function that behaves differently based on the input type.

Instructions:

Create a function that accepts a parameter of type string | number.
The function should:
Return the length if the input is a string.
Return the square if the input is a number.
Task 8: Intersection Types
Objective: Practice using intersection types.

Instructions:

Create a type AdminUser that is an intersection of:
User with properties name and email
Admin with property adminLevel
Write a function describeAdmin(user: AdminUser): string that returns a description of the admin user.
Task 9: Optional Chaining
Objective: Use optional chaining with nested objects.

Instructions:

Write a function getEmployeeCity(employee) that safely retrieves the city of an employee from a nested object using optional chaining.
Task 10: Nullish Coalescing
Objective: Handle null and undefined values using nullish coalescing.

Instructions:

Write a function getDisplayName(name: string | null | undefined): string that returns "Anonymous" if name is null or undefined.
Task 11: Unknown Type
Objective: Handle different types with the unknown type.

Instructions:

Write a function processData(data: unknown) that:
Checks if data is a string and returns the uppercased version.
If data is a number, returns the square of it.
Task 12: Never Type
Objective: Use the never type for functions that don’t return.

Instructions:

Write a function handleError that:
Accepts a message: string.
Throws an error with the given message.
Use the never return type to indicate that this function never returns.
Task 13: Generics with Functions and Interfaces
Objective: Use generics to handle different types.

Instructions:

Create a generic function that:
Accepts an array of any type.
Returns a new array with duplicate values removed.
Task 14: Asynchronous TypeScript and Type Aliases
Objective: Simulate an asynchronous operation with TypeScript.

Instructions:

Write an asynchronous function that:
Simulates fetching user data (containing name and age).
Returns the data after a short delay.
Task 15: Type Guards
Objective: Create custom type guards for more accurate type checking.

Instructions:

Write a function isString(value: unknown): value is string that checks if a value is a string.
Use this in another function printUpperCase(value: unknown): void that prints the value in uppercase if it’s a string.
Task 16: Utility Types and Keyof Constraints
Objective: Access object properties dynamically using keyof.

Instructions:

Create a function that:
Takes an object and a key.
Returns the property value from the object based on the provided key.
Use keyof to constrain the key to valid properties of the object.
Happy coding!
